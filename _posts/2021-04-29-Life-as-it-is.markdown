Last six months have been quite productive for me in terms of physical and mental health. Besides I learnt guitar, that I wish to carry forward in life. Singing with guitar and singing in general has gotten better too. Although not at par when I can share it on social media.

Point of utmost importance is even with all sorts of improvements that happened with my life in general, I don’t think my studies went up considerably so. Yeah cognitively I have become better for most parts. But I guess I need to take it on a whole new level. 6 hours of studying daily. No less. Towards USMLE. 3 hours + 3 hours, ie two slots in a day. You gotta give your best within these 6 hours. This is all you’ve got. And do it according to lecturing planner of 3 months

Finish up with all the systems. Do one quick brush up.

And 

                                                                         

                                                                                 BEWMS

This has to has to be followed. Just 6 hours of studies with movies and guitar and workout, singing and listening to songs and meeting up with Shreya khagesh Rohit boss and ashish.

Stick the lecturing planner in the front wall. Keep striking the things off as you complete them with UFAB

Just watched Siddharth warrier’s podcast and here are my take always.

Every subject and sub subject is connected to other.. try to find that and keep that in mind while studying.

Absorption, retention, consolidation... consolidation = rote revision * pattern recognition.

Play chess, keep playing chess every now and then.

Try to make a forest view out of the tiny pieces of zig saw puzzle.
